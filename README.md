# 📘 Title:
``` 
Implementation of a ChatBot Using Natural Language Processing 

```
# Abstract
```
This mini project focuses on creating a ChatBot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to simulate human-like conversation.
It is designed to respond to user queries, learn patterns, and deliver meaningful responses.
The project demonstrates fundamental NLP concepts including tokenization, pattern matching, and intent classification.
